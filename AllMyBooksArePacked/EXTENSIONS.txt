how your application could be extended to handle the following:

1) Domains beyond Amazon.com
R/= Since all the pages are different, we will need to add a new folder and a new parser file for the new domain.

2) Products beyond just simply books.
R/= Since we are going to get different products we need to take in consideration that some of the properties are just for books like the author,
if we are planning to change the structure of the resulted json we need to make some changes in the in the current parser function, if thats not
the case we will need to add a new function in the parser and check the category of the thing we need to parse.

3) Parse and ship 2,000,000 books (in a reasonably time frame; e.g., polynomial time) instead of merely 20.
R/= Right now the current algorithm finish in a polynomial time since it is not packing the books to get the minimum possible boxes, it is
just making one iteration so if with the next book the box exceeds limit it creates a new box without looking at the next books to see if there is a book
that can be in the same box
